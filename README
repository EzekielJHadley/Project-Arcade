Project Arcade
=========================
This is a game that I, Ezekiel Hadley, am producing. It is a simple set of old school games such as snake
and Tetris. I am building off the games designed in "Flash: Game Development by Example" by Emanuele Feronato.
Each game from the book will be altered to practice game design and Flash programming. I followed the book
in as far as to learn flash and get a good idea on how to program these games.
